# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

  # Window padding (changes require restart)

  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
